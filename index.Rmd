## Project Goals

-   *Deliver* a **scalable**, **reproducible** and **continuously integrated** data analysis compendium that:

    -   *Deploys* Machine Learning algorithms,

    -   *Visualizes* model performances & statistical inference,

    -   *Communicates* findings to target audiences in multiple formats.

-   *Display* best practices at the edge of machine learning knowledge using **R**, placing importance on:

    -   *Packaging* approaches using version control,

    -   *Deploying* computationally efficient algorithms,

    -   *Interfacing* modelling & reporting API's,

    -   *Adopting* a functional programming mindset.

## Project deliverables

-   A data analysis compendium,

-   An R package containing `target`-based `tidymodels` and reporting tools,

-   A pipeline-generated `bookdown` book & `shiny` app,

-   Persistent Github repository for future publishing.

## Project visualization

*click and drag on the image to inspect or move nodes!*

```{r pipeline, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
### TODO: annotate visnetwork with time of last model run
# This chunk is split in two to avoid S3 error issue, see https://github.com/D-Se/ML/issues/13
p <- targets::tar_visnetwork(label = "time")
```

```{r pipeline_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.keep='all', eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.extra='angle=90',comment="", message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
p
```

In this image there are already over 25 000 different models, implemented using 12 modelling packages! Each node represents a step in the `targets` core pipeline.

::: note
<center>
When a file in the pipeline is edited, tho dependencies get rerun! 
</center>
:::

For example, if a set of the models fails, in red, the code needs to be looked at. Another example of such dependency is **this** book, which in itself is *parameterized*.

*keras* neural nets, *MARS*, *Random Forests*, *SVM* are already part of the `ML` API. This project uses `R` & `C++` for computation, `JavaScript`, `HTML` & `CSS` for reporting, `YAML`, `TeX` and `AWK` for text formatting. Whether you like **modelling**, **visualizing**, or **communicating**, this projects offers the chance to explore best R practices. And the best part? We don't have to leave RStudio at all for any of it.
