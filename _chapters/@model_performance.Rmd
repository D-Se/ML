# Model performance

Here is an example constructed from sample data, training 12 different ML models.

::: question
<center>
Which model performed the best?
</center>
:::


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
targets::tar_read(ranking) +
  theme_bw()
```

A quick overview, obtained from a node in the pipeline.

::: note

<center>
Always check the actual predictions to look for anomalies!
</center>
:::

And to check if the predictions are close to the actual observations, we inspect another node from the pipeline.
```{r}
targets::tar_read(visual_verify) +
  theme_bw()
```

Looks good. What is the error metric associated with this?

```{r}
targets::tar_read(metrics)
```


::: question
<center>
Looks neat! how do I get this model in my RStudio to test it?
</center>

That is the benefit of making your own package.   
- Simply run `ML::results` to get the best performing model straight into your R session
- Look at the documentation by running `?results`.
