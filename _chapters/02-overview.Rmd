# Overview {#overview}

## Quick start

::: package
`ML` is a scalable data analysis *compendium* that interfaces to well known APIs like `tidyverse`, `tidymodels`, `shiny`, `bookdown`.
:::

`ML` is already quite rich in functionality.  
It: 1. Uses functional programming - it fetches, validates, transforms and cleans data,

2.  Specifies modelling workflows,

3.  Implements those workflows *asynchronously*,

4.  Collect metrics, visualizes model performance,

5.  Constructs this book, and a Shiny API!

6.  And finally, exports finalized models to end users as convenient objects for inspection and sharing.

To start modelling, use

``` r
devtools::install_github("D-Se/ML")
```

Want to retrieve an intermediate step of the analysis pipeline? Sure! Here is *an example of a xgboost tree model, displaying its hyperparameters that need tuning.*

```{r model_spec_example}
ML::analysis$models$xgb_spec
```

::: theory
Our team finds the best models and present them in an engaging way: a book!

## Github repo

The [Github repo](https://github.com/D-Se/ML) is where the project lives. In it, you can find, among many others, the following files.

```{verbatim}
├── .github  >>> github workflows, automated checking
├── R/  >>> directory for ML package functions.
├──── ... >>> regular R package functions. o sub-directory allowed.
├── inst/  >>> supplementary materials for ML package
├── man/  >>> automatically generated package documentation [NO EDIT]
├──── figures/ >>> images used
├── src/  >>> compiled (C++) code used in ML package
├── tests/  >>> unit tests for package functions
├──── testthat/ >>> directory of unit test
├── vignettes/  >>> long-form documentation
├── .Rbuildignore/ >>> package utility: instruction set to ignore non-standard files
├── .gitignore  >>> instruction set to RStudio to ignore files in directory for version control

```

The project is split up into segments, each ending with finishing a deliverable. These steps can be found in the [milestones](https://github.com/D-Se/ML/milestones) section of the repo. The milestones are made up of collections of [issues](https://github.com/D-Se/ML/issues). These are tasks assigned to project members, and can be added by any person with access rights to the repo. [labels](https://github.com/D-Se/ML/labels) are placed on issues to make it easy to find and assign tasks. Each issue is allocated a *difficulty* and *priority* label, and further labels were appropriate.

## Project Planning

In such a large scale approach where multiple people contribute models, code, opinions et cetera it is important to keep track of who does what, and how things are going.

To keep our focus straight, automation tools are available, such as *Github* commit-tracking to give insights who *exactly* did what, when.

```{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/bash sh
# count lines of code per contributor to github repo in main .rmd files
contr () {
  local perfile="false";
  if [[ $1 = "-f" ]]; then
  perfile="true";
  shift;
  fi;
  if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
          echo "no files given!" 1>&2;
        return 1;
        else
          local f; {
            for f in "$@";
            do
            echo "$f";
            git blame --show-email "$f" |
              sed -nE 's/^[^ ]* *.<([^>]*)>.*$/: \1/p' |
              sort | uniq -c | sort -r -nk1;
            done
          } | if [[ "$perfile" = "true" ]]; then
        tee /tmp/s.txt;
        else
          tee /tmp/s.txt > /dev/null;
        fi;
        awk -v FS='*: *' '/^ *[0-9]/{sums[$2] += $1} END {
        for (i in sums) printf("%7s : %s\n", sums[i], i)
        }' /tmp/s.txt |
          sort -r -nk1;
        fi
}
find . -iname '*.Rmd' | while read file; do contr -f "$file"; done > dev/counts.txt
```

Hmm, I see there might be an issue! Let's deal with them through Github!

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Github repository issues pane", out.width = '100%', out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/issues.png")
```
